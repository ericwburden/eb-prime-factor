# Calculate Prime Factors

This crate contains a small program to calculate the prime factors of positive integers, up to u64::MAX (18,446,744,073,709,551,615). You can install `eb-prime-factor` using `cargo install eb-prime-factor` if you have a working Rust toolchain (I recommend you use [rustup](https://rustup.rs)) to get you there. Once installed, (assuming you have ~/.cargo/bin in your PATH), invoke with `eb-prime-factor <some number>`.
